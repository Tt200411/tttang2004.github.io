        I am focused on explainable deep learning, machine learning, and optimization theory research. As a research assistant at CUHK-Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, I am committed to applying chaos dynamics theory to financial forecasting and time series analysis.

        Current research focuses include: developing chaotic neural network architectures based on Lee oscillators, designing multifractal feature extraction algorithms, and constructing robust deep learning prediction models. My work has been submitted to several top-tier journals, including Chaos, Solitons & Fractals and IEEE TNNLS.
